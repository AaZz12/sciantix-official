# sciantix-official
This repository contains the SCIANTIX code, together with the validation database and regression files.

SCIANTIX simulates the behaviour of inert gases (xenon, krypton, and helium) in nuclear fuel, at the scale of a single fuel grain.
The code can be compiled and used as a standalone tool, or coupled with thermo-mechanical fuel performance codes.
