# sciantix-official / main
The branch 'sciantix-official / main' contains the new sciantix 2.0 version, together with the validation database and regression files.


# Installation

## On Linux
1. Obtain the code (either by `git clone` or by downloading the `zip`)
2. Install dependencies
    - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential`
3. Compile all by typing `make` in the obtained code directory
    - to utilize more cores, use `make -j`
    - a directory called `bin` with executable `sciantix.x` should appear
4. (optional) Compile the code documentation by typing `doxygen` in the code directory
    - if `doxygen` is not found, install by `sudo apt install doxygen`
5. (optional) Run regression tests to verify everything works correctly
    ```
    cd regression
    python regression.py
    ```

## On Windows

A possible approach is throught the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

1. [Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

2. Once having installed WSL, download the code `zip` and unpack it. 

3. Run WSL (by typing `wsl` in `cmd.exe` or as `Ubuntu` application in Start menu). Navigate to the unpacked code directory (possibly by  `cd /mnt/c/...`, where `...` should be changed to code directory path).

4. Follow instructions for Linux from point 2.


# Usage

To run Sciantix, execute call the `sciantix.x` executable inside directory with the input files.

Refer to [Input file Explanation](utilities/InputExplanation.md) for input syntax manual.

Some examples of input files can be found
- in the `regression` directory,
- in the `utilities/inputExample` directory by running the Python files
    ```
    python utilities/inputExample/print_input_initial_conditions.py
    python utilities/inputExample/print_input_scaling_factors.py
    python utilities/inputExample/print_input_settings.py
    ```
